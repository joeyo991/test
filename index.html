        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div id="about-text">
            <p>My name is John Smith and I am the founder and fitness expert behind 121 Fitness. With 15 years of gym experience and a degree in both sports science and nutrition, there is nobody better to learn from. Starting off as a small business to help family and friends, 121 Fitness has grown and now has over 300 clients and 25 employees accross Ireland and the UK. I have always been into fitness, first joining a gym at age 16. My friends saw how healthy, happy and dedicated I looked and asked me to help them be the same. At first I did it for free because I enjoyed it, but as more and more people came to me for help, I realised there was an oppurtunity for me to make a career out of this. I can now say I have made a career out of this and enjoyed every minute of it, and so have my clients. Check out some of their reviews below. I look forward to working with you!</p></p>

        <div>
            <p>"121 Fitness has given me my life back. When I first signed up I was nearly 350lbs, 2 and a half years later and I am 210lbs. My plan made sure I didn't rush anything but instead I was doing everything right. The plans are easy to follow and they work!"</p>

            <p>"I was going to the gym for 3 years without seeing any results. A friend told me about 121 Fitness so I reached out and straight away the team pointed out that my diet was all wrong. I'm 6 months into my nutrition plan and I have seen amazing progress. Thank you 121 Fitness!"</p>

            <p>"I am an electrician and work long hours so I have limited time to work out during the week. The plan that 121 Fitness has me following lets me make the most of my time and also keeps me eating healthy when I'm working. They're amazing!"</p>

            <p>"Working in a restaurant made my eating and exercise habits terrible for 11 years, but thanks to my new plan from 121 Fitness, I'm eating better, training better and feeling better. I have never been happier, 5 stars!"</p>
